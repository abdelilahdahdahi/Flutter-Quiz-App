# QuizLand App - Flutter
My first ever app "QuizLand" made with Flutter &amp; Dart. <br>
Inspired and supported by a Udemy course, I managed to learn Flutter basics and create this very simple app.

The quiz contains only 3 questions about some country capitals which, based on your answers (right or false) you get 1 or 0 point. <br>
Eventually you'll receive a feedback, if you answered all right 3/3: "Excellent", 2/3: "Good", 1/3: "Could be better", 0/3: "Don't skip Geography class!" xD
