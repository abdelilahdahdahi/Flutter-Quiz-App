# QuizLand App - Flutter
My first ever app "QuizLand" made with Flutter &amp; Dart. <br>
Inspired and supported by a Udemy course, I managed to learn some Flutter basics and create this very simple app.

The quiz contains only questions about some country capitals, one you finish answering you'll receive a feedback sentence based on your score <br>
Then you can restart the quiz, but the questions will be always the same :( I know it's meaningless, but as my first app it's acceptable. <br>
Looking forward to making better and complex apps in the coming future!
